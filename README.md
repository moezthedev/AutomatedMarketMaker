This repository contains a Solidity smart contract for a Constant Sum Automated Market Maker (AMM). This AMM facilitates asset trading by maintaining a constant sum of reserves for two tokens. It includes functionality for adding and removing liquidity, swapping assets, and managing allowances.

Overview
The Constant Sum AMM maintains a constant sum of two token reserves. Users can add or remove liquidity and swap between the two tokens with a fee applied to each swap.

Key Features
Add Liquidity: Deposit a specified amount of each token to the AMM.
Remove Liquidity: Withdraw a specified amount of each token from the AMM.
Swap Tokens: Swap one token for another with a fee.
Approve Spender: Approve an address to spend tokens on behalf of the contract.
Transfer Tokens: Transfer tokens from the contract to a specified recipient.
Contract Details
ConstantSumAMM
A smart contract implementing a Constant Sum AMM.

Constructor:

constructor(address _token0, address _token1)
_token0: Address of the first token.
_token1: Address of the second token.
Functions:

addLiquidity(uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) Adds liquidity to the AMM. Tokens are transferred from the user's account to the contract. Emits an AddLiquidity event.

removeLiquidity(uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) Removes liquidity from the AMM. Tokens are transferred from the contract to the user's account. Emits a RemoveLiquidity event.

swap(address tokenIn, uint256 amountIn) Swaps one token for another based on the constant sum formula. A fee is deducted from the input amount. Emits a Swap event.

approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) Approves a spender to manage the contractâ€™s token allowances.

transferToken0(address recipient, uint256 amount) Transfers a specified amount of token0 from the contract to the recipient.

transferToken1(address recipient, uint256 amount) Transfers a specified amount of token1 from the contract to the recipient.

Events:

AddLiquidity(address indexed provider, uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) Emitted when liquidity is added.

RemoveLiquidity(address indexed provider, uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) Emitted when liquidity is removed.

Swap(address indexed user, address indexed tokenIn, uint256 amountIn, address indexed tokenOut, uint256 amountOut) Emitted when a swap occurs.
